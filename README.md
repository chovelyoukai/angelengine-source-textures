# Angel Engine Source Textures
---
These are some of the textures from Angel Engine in a format that works for Source. Inside the `custom` folder are the VMTs and VTFs for Source. You can drag and drop the `custom` folder inside your game directory and it should just work.

In addition, if you are using TrenchBroom, the textures in PNG format are also included. Simply put the `textures` folder inside of your game directory as well. For example, if you are using Team Fortress 2, you should have something like `tf/custom/angelengine` and `tf/textures`.
